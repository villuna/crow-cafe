## Intro: Player shows up at the cafe and is given direction from corey

Corey - hey, you must be the new guy i heard about. 

i've been the only barista here for a while, so i'm up to my beak in work. it'll be nice to have an extra pair of wings on deck.

listen, we open in a couple minutes. we'll need to get working now if we don't wanna fall behind.

sorry to throw you out of the nest like this, but there's no time for training. you'll have to learn to fly on your own.

hm? you don't know what you're supposed to be doing?

why, you'll be playing *microwgames* of course.

good luck!
